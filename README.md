# FairyChess

This is not my idea!

Design, rules, and inspiration comes from [Fairy Chess](http://abstractstrategygames.blogspot.com/2010/10/fairy-chess.html)

Game is has no end, but has input validation

- Controls-
WASD - up/left/down/right
Q - Quit
Enter - Select piece, accept movement
R - Select movement selection type
Escape - Choose different piece

If you hover over a piece on your turn, it'll show all available moves

Movement types:
- List. Left/Right will cycle through all moves of selected piece like a list
- Free. No restrictions, X if you cannot move there
The reasons why I keep list is for Castling, if you choose that setup.
